Items that impose additional crew training or impact crew procedures. 2. Items that impact the accomplishment of detailed test objectives. 3. Items that result in a significant RCS or EPS budget change. 4. Items that result in moving major activities to a different activity day in the Flight Plan. 5. Items that require a change to the flight data file. The Chief, Flight Planning Branch (FCSD) will determine what proposed changes fall in the above categories. Mr. T. A.
